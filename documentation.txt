This project will be based on Folium as we need a world map to pick geographical data. 

Folium - Folium is a Python library used for visualizing geospatial data. It is easy to 
use and yet a powerful library. Folium is a Python wrapper for Leaflet. js which is a 
leading open-source JavaScript library for plotting interactive maps. It has the power of Leaflet. 

Folium has a class called Map which we use in our project.
